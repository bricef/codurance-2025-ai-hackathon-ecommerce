Starter repository for the ecommerce challenge based on a fictitious fashion company as part of the Codurance AI Hackathon


# StyleDen

## Context
StyleDen is an ambitious fashion startup that curates affordable, stylish clothing for Gen Z and young millennial shoppers.  
They've been operating through social media and online marketplaces but are now ready to launch their own direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform.

As part of this launch, StyleDen wants to build a **minimal viable product (MVP)** for their e-commerce website.  
They‚Äôre looking for a prototype that demonstrates:
- How customers can browse the clothing catalogue
- View individual product details
- Add items to a shopping cart

The company is open to using any technology stack or framework (React, Vue, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, etc.).  
The only restriction: **no low-code or no-code tools** may be used.

The **UI/UX is completely up to you**.  
StyleDen encourages creativity and wants to see how you'd approach designing a modern, user-friendly fashion e-commerce experience from scratch.

They've suggested a public dataset from Kaggle to seed your product catalogue:  
üîó [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small)

---

## Required Features

### üõçÔ∏è Product Catalogue Page
- Display a list of fashion items (from the dataset) including **name, image, price, and category**.
- Include **basic filtering** (e.g., by category or season) and **sorting**.

### üîç Product Detail Page
- When a product is clicked, navigate to a detail page showing additional information such as **brand**, **year**, and **season**.

### üõí Shopping Cart
- Allow users to **add items** to a cart and **view a summary** of the selected items.
- Users should be able to **change quantities** and **remove items**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend API
- Build a backend API that:
  - **Serves the product data**
  - **Manages the shopping cart logic**
- The backend should source product data from the Kaggle dataset (loaded into a local database or kept in memory).

### üé® Basic UI Styling
- Include enough styling to demonstrate thoughtful **UI/UX design** for a fashion-focused brand.
- You may use any design library (e.g., **Tailwind**, **Bootstrap**, **Material UI**) or custom CSS.

### üíæ Persisted Cart State
- Persist the shopping cart state locally (e.g., in **localStorage** or in the backend) so the cart survives a page refresh.
